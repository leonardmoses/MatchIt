## Title: **Match It**

**Description:**
  This application is a card matching game. Similar to other matching games a user may click on the back face of a card to reveal it.

**App Inspiration:**
  I have always been interestd in game apps I wanted to finally get my feet wet to diversify my developement skill set.

**Technologies Used:**
  Next.Js, Javascript, CSS, SASS for the frontend. Future implementation will add python, Django for backend.

**Getting Started:**
  1. To get started click on this link to go to the app's deployed domain.
  https://match-it-eight.vercel.app/
  2. You will be greeted with a Splash page. The app has two pages. You may either click on gamerules or play game. 
  3. Game rules will give you a brief desciption of what to do once you play.
  4. In the gameplay board the user is greeted with all their cards faced down. The apps functionality allows them to click on a card to reveal the card. They may then click on a second card. They can keep clicking on a card to toggle it to face up or down.

  **Future Enhancement:**
  As of now toggling between a card facing up and down is all the app can do. Future implementations are coming soon where game logic will determine whether the card is match. If it's a match then the cards will remain faced up. If it's not a match then both cards will flip back over. The app will also keep score of how many times the user attemps card flips. In the end there will be a score based on how many card flip attempts the user took to complete.
